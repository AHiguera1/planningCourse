# Implement path-planning algorithms

## Objectives

* Understand the importance of path-planning in robotics.
* Study and implement well-known path planning algorithms.
* Compare the algorithms using different heuristics.


## Introduction

The pseudocode that will be used in this practical assignment is taken from the article [Theta*: Any-Angle Path Planning on Grids](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3843.pdf) published in the Journal of AI Research, 39: 533-579 (2010). 

The algorithms will be implemented in Python, and there will be two different practical assignments depending on the lab group. Upload to the platform ONLY the practical assignments corresponding to your lab group. Uploading a different one will be considered as not **performed** and then, it will not be taken into account into the lab mark.
