# Getting started with PDDL

## Objectives

* Practice PDDL 1.2 syntax. Check the manual [here](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mfourman/tools/propplan/pddl.pdf).

* Implement and run PDDL models.

## Introduction

In order to help in the resolution of problems, one can check the International Planning Competitions (IPC) where you can find a variety of domains. Some links are:

* [CSU Planning Repository: AIPS 2002 Planning Competition Problems and Domains](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/meps/repository/aips2002.html)

* [IPC 2011 domains](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/ipc2011-deterministic/Domains)


## Exercises 
This practical assignment consists of 5 exercises. The first exercise is already modelled. The second and third exercises are partially modelled. The rest has to be modelled from scratch. Each domain should be in a separate folder and should contain the domain file and the problem files. 
 -  Exercise 1: [Gripper](Gripper.md).
 -  Exercise 2: [Blocksworld](Blocksworld.md)
 -  Exercise 3: [Space Operation](SpaceOperation.md)
 -  Exercise 4: [Planning Motion](PlanningMotion.md)
 -  Exercise 5: [Rocket](Rocket.md)
