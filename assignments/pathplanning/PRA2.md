# Implementation and comparison of heuristics for path-planning


## Objectives

* Compare Dijkstra, A* or Theta*algorithms.
* Implement Theta* and some heuristics.
* Understand the impact of the heuristic selection in path-planning.
* Use a graphical interface to visualize the results.

## Dependencies

EXPLICAR COMO se realiza la visualizaci√≥n sobre una imagen

## Practical assignment

Perform the following tasks:

1. Use the following functions to visualize paths on images. (EXPLICAR!!!!)

2. Consider that the robot is initially located at the position (18,19) and the goal is to be at position (12,12). Visualizes the computed path using the Dijkstra algorithm. Change the initial point to  (27,19) and the goal point to (8,20).
   
3. We provide you with the implementation of A* and Dijkstra. The implementation of A* is based on the  pseudo-code of the next figure:

4. Implement Theta* using the following pseudo-code:

<img align="center" src="Theta*.png" width="600">

Take into account that the difference between A* and Theta* is the Line of sight. Here is the code to calculate it:

5. Which heuristic is used by default? If needed, use the path-planning visualizer in https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/ to reconstruct the scenario and observe the node expansion using different algorithms.

6. Implement the Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics for A*/Theta*. Both functions take the initial and final points as tuples (X, Y) and must return a float with the heuristic value.

8. Run the 3 algorithms and compare the results, changing when appropriate the heuristic.
