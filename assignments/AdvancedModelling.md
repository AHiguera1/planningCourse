# Advanced modelling in PDDL

## Objectives

* Practice PDDL 2.X and 3.X syntax. Check the manuals for more details:
[PDDL2.X](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol20/JAIR-2002.pdf).
[PDDL3.X](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dvm/papers/pddl-ipc5.pdf)

* Implement and run temporal models and preferences.

## Exercises 
This practical assignment consists of 6 exercises, with the first one solved in the lab. Each domain should be in a separate folder and should contain the domain file and the problem files.
 -  Exercise 1: [Extended Gripper](ExtendedGripper.md)
 -  Exercise 2: [Extended Planetary exploration on Mars](ExtPlanetaryExploration.md) 
 -  Exercise 3: [Extended Pizzeria](ExtPizza.md)
 -  Exercise 4: [Building](Building.md)
 -  Exercise 5: [Moving Out](MovingOut.md)
 -  Exercise 6: Model a full temporal domain and problem (at least 2) where you think AI planning can be helpful. Do not use tipical AI examples such as the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem. You need to generate, at least, half page description of the problem and the actions modelled.
