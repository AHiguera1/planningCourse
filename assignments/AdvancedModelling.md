# Advanced modelling in PDDL

## Objectives

* Practice PDDL 2.1 syntax. Check the manual [here](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol20/JAIR-2002.pdf).

* Implement and run temporal models.

## Exercises 
This practical assignment consists of 4 exercises. Each domain should be in a separate folder and should contain the domain file and the problem files. Upload to Blackboard in a .zip all the exercises before the deadline. Each **delayed week**, will be penalised by **0.25**.
 -  Exercise 1: Airport.md
 -  Exercise 2: PlanetaryExploration.md
 -  Exercise 3: Building.md
 -  Exercise 4: Model a full temporal domain and problem (at least 2) where you think AI planning can be helpful. You need to generate a half page description of the problem and the actions.
